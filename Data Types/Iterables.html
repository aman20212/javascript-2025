  <h2>Iterables</h2>
  <p>
    Iterable objects are a generalization of arrays. That‚Äôs a concept that
    allows us to make any object useable in a <b>for..of </b>loop.

  <h2>Symbol.iterator</h2>
  <p>
    We can easily grasp the concept of iterables by making one of our own.<br />
    For instance, we have an object that is not an array, but looks suitable for
    for..of.<br />
    Like a range object that represents an interval of numbers:
    <pre>
        <code>
            let range = {
                from: 1,
                to: 5
            };
              
            // We want the for..of to work:
            // for(let num of range) ... num=1,2,3,4,5
        </code>
    </pre>
    But, if we execute the code:
    <pre>
        <code>
            for (let num of range) {
                console.log(num);
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    We will get error: <b>Uncaught TypeError: range is not iterable</b><br>
    <p>To make the <b>range</b> object iterable (and thus let <b>for..of</b> work) we need to add a method to the object named<br><b> Symbol.iterator</b> (a special built-in symbol just for that).
    <br>
    <br>
    1. When <b>for..of</b> starts, it calls that method once (or errors if not found). The method must return an iterator ‚Äì an object with the method <b>next</b>.<br>
    2. Onward, <b>for..of</b> works only with that returned object.<br>
    3. When <b>for..of</b> wants the next value, it calls <b>next()</b> on that object.<br>
    4. The result of <b>next()</b> must have the form <b>{done: Boolean, value: any}</b>, where <b>done=true</b> means that the loop is finished, otherwise <b>value</b> is the next value.</p>
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
        let range = {
            from: 1,
            to: 5
          };
          
          // 1. call to for..of initially calls this
          range[Symbol.iterator] = function() {
          
            // ...it returns the iterator object:
            // 2. Onward, for..of works only with the iterator object below, asking it for next values
            return {
              current: this.from,
              last: this.to,
          
              // 3. next() is called on each iteration by the for..of loop
              next() {
                // 4. it should return the value as an object {done:.., value :...}
                if (this.current <= this.last) {
                  return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
                } else {
                  return { done: true };
                }
              }
            };
          };
          
          // now it works!
          for (let num of range) {
            alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5
          }
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p style="color: brown;">
    Please note the core feature of iterables: separation of concerns.<br>

1. The range itself does not have the next() method.<br>
2. Instead, another object, a so-called ‚Äúiterator‚Äù is created by the call to range[Symbol.iterator](), and its next() generates values for the iteration.<br>
3. So, the iterator object is separate from the object it iterates over.<br>
<br><br>
Technically, we may merge them and use range itself as the iterator to make the code simpler.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
        let range = {
            from: 1,
            to: 5,
          
            [Symbol.iterator]() {
              this.current = this.from;
              return this;
            },
          
            next() {
              if (this.current <= this.to) {
                return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
              } else {
                return { done: true };
              }
            }
          };
          
          for (let num of range) {
            alert(num); // 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5
          }
    </code>
  </pre>
  Now <b>range[Symbol.iterator]()</b> returns the <b>range</b> object itself: it has the necessary <b>next()</b> method and remembers the current iteration progress in <b>this.current</b>. Shorter? Yes. And sometimes that‚Äôs fine too.<br>

The downside is that now it‚Äôs impossible to have two <b>for..of</b> loops running over the object simultaneously: they‚Äôll share the iteration state, because there‚Äôs only one iterator ‚Äì the object itself. But two parallel for-ofs is a rare thing, even in async scenarios.

    <h2>String is iterable</h2>
    <p>Arrays and strings are most widely used built-in iterables.<br>
        For a string, <b>for..of</b> loops over its characters:<br>
        <pre>
            <code>
                for (let char of "test") {
                    // triggers 4 times: once for each character
                    alert( char ); // t, then e, then s, then t
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        And it works correctly with surrogate pairs!
        <pre>
            <code>
                let str = 'ùí≥üòÇ';
                for (let char of str) {
                    alert( char ); // ùí≥, and then üòÇ
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Calling an iterator explicitly</h3>
    <p>For deeper understanding, let‚Äôs see how to use an iterator explicitly.<br>

        We‚Äôll iterate over a string in exactly the same way as for..of, but with direct calls. This code creates a string iterator and gets values from it ‚Äúmanually‚Äù:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let str = "Hello";

            // does the same as
            // for (let char of str) alert(char);

            let iterator = str[Symbol.iterator]();

            while (true) {
            let result = iterator.next();
            if (result.done) break;
            alert(result.value); // outputs characters one by one
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    That is rarely needed, but gives us more control over the process than for..of. For instance, we can split the iteration process: iterate a bit, then stop, do something else, and then resume later.

    <h2>Iterables and array-likes</h2>
    <p>Two official terms look similar, but are very different. Please make sure you understand them well to avoid the confusion.<br><br>

        <i>Iterables</i> are objects that implement the <b>Symbol.iterator</b> method, as described above.<br><br>
        <i>Array-likes</i> are objects that have <b>indexes</b> and <b>length</b>, so they look like arrays.<br><br>
        When we use JavaScript for practical tasks in a browser or any other environment, we may meet objects that are iterables or array-likes, or both.<br><br>
        
        For instance, strings are both iterable (<b>for..of</b> works on them) and array-like (they have numeric indexes and <b>length</b>).<br><br>
        
        But an iterable may not be array-like. And vice versa an array-like may not be iterable.<br><br>
        
        For example, the <b>range</b> in the example above is iterable, but not array-like, because it does not have indexed properties and <b>length</b>.<br><br>
        
        And here‚Äôs the object that is array-like, but not iterable:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let arrayLike = { // has indexes and length => array-like
                    0: "Hello",
                    1: "World",
                    length: 2
                  };
                  
                  // Error (no Symbol.iterator)
                  for (let item of arrayLike) {}
            </code>
        </pre>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
    <h2>Array.from</h2>
    <p>There‚Äôs a universal method <b>Array.from</b> that takes an iterable or array-like value and makes a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Array from it. Then we can call array methods on it.</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let arrayLike = {
                0: "Hello",
                1: "World",
                length: 2
              };
              
              let arr = Array.from(arrayLike); // (*)
              alert(arr.pop()); // World (method works)
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
